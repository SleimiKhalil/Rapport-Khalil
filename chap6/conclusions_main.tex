\textbf{In tThis section I reflect on my Experience with Tunisie Telecom, and the big lessons I learned there.}


I can honestly say that my time spent interning with Tunisie Telecom resulted in one of the best summers of my life.  Not only did I gain practical skills but I also had the opportunity to meet many fantastic people. The atmosphere at the Belvedere Data Transmission Center was always welcoming which made me feel right at home. Additionally, I felt like I was able to contribute to the company by assisting and working on a project throughout the summer.

I learned a lot of skills that will be very helpful for me throughout my career, and the experience taught the importnace to think before you write and also the importance of backing up your work: You never know when your PC might fail!

Overall, my internship at Tunisie Telecom has been a success. I was able to gain practical skills, work in a fantastic environment, and make connections that will last a lifetime. I could not be more thankful.

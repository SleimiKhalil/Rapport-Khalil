	%This  internship  report stresseson  the  work  experience  I  have  gathered  as an  Intern in the --- department of Tunisie Telecom. from July 6, 2019 until Aout 7, 2019 (actually Aout 30, 2019).
  \textbf{Stock Management Programs} that are based on \textbf{Databases} can be a huge time savior, lowering the \textbf{time} it takes to find what you're looking for and minimizing the risk for \textbf{data inconsistencies} and \textbf{redundance} that are found among many alternatives like .xml files, also it can guarantee a \textbf{separation of concerns} through different \textbf{permissions}, and that in turn lowers the risk of users tinkering with things they are not allowed to.\\
In this report we talk about the \textbf{conception}, \textbf{design} and \textbf{realisation} of a Stock Management WebApp for Tunisie Telecom's Stock of fiber optics, with a separation of Permissions between what different User types can do.%\blindtext

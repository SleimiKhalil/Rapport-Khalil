\begin{abstract}
  There are a few reasons why we use \textbf{Stock Management Apps} that are based on \textbf{Databases}, lowering the \textbf{time} it takes to find what we're looking for and minimizing the risk for \textbf{data inconsistencies} and \textbf{redundancy} that are found among many alternatives like .xml files, also it can guarantee a \textbf{separation of concerns} through different \textbf{levels of permissions}, and that in turn lowers the risk of users tinkering with things they are not allowed to - or even limiting their access.\\
In this report we talk about the \textbf{conception}, \textbf{design} and \textbf{realisation} of a Stock Management Application for Tunisie Telecom's Stock of fiber optics, with a separation of Permissions between what different User types can do.%\blindtext
